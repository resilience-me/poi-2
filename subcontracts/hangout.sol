   Anti-sybil fuel (ASF) is used to gamify the POI hangouts. Participants can 
   use it to "guide each other's attention", and also to downvote multi-group scammers. 
   Hangout-attendees get to deal out +5000 "anti-sybil fuel" (ASF), and -2000 ASF, 
   and need to receive +4000 to be verified. The ASF points have been balanced so that
   if 2 multi-group scammers are grouped togeher, the 3 other hangout-attendees have
   the power to down-vote those two with 3x-2000 points, preventing them from being verified.
   It has also been balanced so that in a group where only 2 people show up for some reason, 
   those 2 are not penalized and can verify one another.
